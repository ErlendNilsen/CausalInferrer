Causal inference (in ecology) via DAGs, Bayesian networks, and linear (mixed) models

For a while I've been interested in causal inference, but struggled to apply the concepts to ecology. Inferring causality is not always necessary in ecology - sometimes we just want to model (i.e. predict) things within a particular context - but in ecological management, i.e. interventions, or for predicting, i.e. projecting a model to novel times and contexts, we are assuming causality. 

This repo is where I am trying to work out - once and for all (kind of) - how different models common in ecology relate to causal inference. 

It consists of a 'theory' document - which also lists a bunch of references for further reading. I am also planning to develop a 'tutorial' using synthesised data to illustrate the concepts. 

DISCLAIMER: I am no 'expert' in this and while I've tried my best, there could be some inaccuracies. Please let me know where these occur, and why.
